These test cases can be used to test-drive a solution to the diamond kata, in an incremental manner.
There is a description of the Diamond Kata below.

Instructions:
1. Make the first test case for Diamond A pass
2. change the 'ignore_' to 'test_' for the next test case. Make it pass.
3. Uncomment the next line of the test case. Make it pass
4. When all the lines of code in the test case are passing, continue to the next test case.
5. When all the test cases are uncommented and passing, you should have a full working solution.

Diamond Kata
