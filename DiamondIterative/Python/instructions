These test cases can be used to test-drive a solution to the diamond kata, 
in an interative manner.
Enable only one test case for "Diamond A", one for "Diamond B" 
and one for "Diamond C" at any one time. The idea is that you iterate 
towards a full solution.
There is a description of the Diamond Kata below.

Instructions:
1. Make the first test for Diamond A (which is failing) pass.
2. change the 'ignore_' to 'test_' in the next test case. Make it pass too.
3. change the 'test_' back to 'ignore_' in that test case, (or delete it), 
and instead use the following test case.
4. keep doing this until you have exactly one test case for each diamond, 
(A, B, and C), and you've got to the end of the file.
At that point you should have a working implementation.

Diamond Kata
------------

Given a letter print a diamond starting with 'A'
with the supplied letter at the widest point.

For example: print-diamond 'E' prints

    A
   B B
  C   C
 D     D
E       E
 D     D
  C   C
   B B
    A

For example: print-diamond 'C' prints

  A
 B B
C   C
 B B
  A
