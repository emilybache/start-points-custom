This exercise builds on the original "HtmlTextConverter" problem, by showing you how to 
use a Fake to test it. You want to write the unit tests for the UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter class,
but without writing many tests that all open a real file. Instead you can write tests using 
a "fake" file, that is, a 'std::stringstream', that is all in memory. 

The UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter class is designed to reformat a 
plain text file for display in a browser.

Look at the example in "StreamConverter.tests.cpp", and create some more similar tests.

Instead of std::stringstream, could you use GoogleMock to create a Stub file? Would that be
easier or harder?
