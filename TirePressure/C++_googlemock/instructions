This exercise builds on the original "Tire Pressure" exercise, showing how to use
a Stub to test the Alarm class.

The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm 
if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. 

The PressureSensor class provided for the exercise fakes the behaviour of a 
real tire sensor, providing random but realistic values.

Write more test cases in 'Alarm.tests.cpp' using the StubSensor, so that the Alarm class is fully tested.
